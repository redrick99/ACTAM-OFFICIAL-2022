        <p>A smooth and popular type of chord voicing are called (Bill Evans style) Rootless Chord Voicings. As the name suggests, these chord voicings exclude the root note. Instead of the root (and sometimes the 5th) we play chord tensions. This gives us a jazzy sound (because of the tensions) while not being too crowded (you only ever play 4 notes because we drop the root).</p>

        <p>In short, Rootless Chord Voicings are played as follows:</p>

        <p>These voicing works really well for II-V-I progressions, because you only need to change a few notes (and by only a small interval) to move from one chord to the next (i.e. there is smooth <b>voice leading</b>)</p>

        <p>Thelonious Monk is a Bebop Pianist known for his dissonant, quirky and asymmetrical style, rhythm and harmony. So, as you would expect, Thelonious Monk Chord Voicings have a bit of ‘bite’ (read dissonance). They have a semitone interval at the bottom of the chord and a 3rd on top. And because there are only two semitones in a diatonic scale (both Major and melodic minor), then there are only two possible chord shapes – one for the tonic chord and one for every other chord in that key.</p>

        <p>In short, the Thelonious Monk Chord voicings in <b>Major Harmony</b> are:</p>
        <ul className="text-list">

        <p>In Jazz, it’s possible to omit the less important notes (root & 5th) to create a Shell Chord. Bud Powell Chord Voicings are also Shell Chords (they contain only two or three notes), but they always include the root (establishing the tonality of the chord). To facilitate this (and still keep it a Shell Chord) we drop either the 3rd or the 7th. This means you could argue that they are not ‘full and proper chords’</p>

        <p>They provide a strong sense of tonality precisely because they always include the root as the bottom note of the chord. And playing the root note of every chord as the bass note really spells out a chord progression.</p>

        <p>An important part of being a competent jazz pianists is being able to voice chords with two hands. Three Note Voicings are a good way of beginning to do this.
